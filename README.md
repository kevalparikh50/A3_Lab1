   This is the webpage project to about using javascript.this file has three different cooper cards images which has different models and    different description and prices.when I click on each images the other two images would be off in opacity and the description of the      car should showed up.
    I am going to write javascript in two different files.first is carData.js and second file is main.js.In the carData.js file I am going 
    to write descrption,price and model number in the one variable and then it needs to trigger in function when it clicked.
    so this is the car project.
